// page it serves. Paint the join screen with PhoneJoinPanel.

// Every e-Minimal portal but Game Night raises one network: SHARED_SSID, WPA2
// with sharedPassphrase(), generated once and kept, so a phone saves it once
// and rejoins by itself whichever feature raised it. The join QR carries the
// passphrase, so a scanned join costs nothing and only the typed fallback
// shows it. A Config without a passphrase raises an open network.
