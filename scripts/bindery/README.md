# Convert (Bindery) — tools and tests

The Convert page (`src/network/html/ConvertPage.html`, served at `/convert`)
turns manga, comics and books into files the reader opens fast. The logic is in
`src/network/html/js/bindery-core.js` (pure: zip, dithering, XTC/EPUB writers,
text parsing) and `bindery-app.js` (decoding, drawing, preview, upload).

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `build_standalone.py` | one self-contained HTML file (pdf.js inside) → `build/bindery/eminimal-convert.html`. Opens from disk, no network. |
| `make_fixtures.py` | grey 1404×1872 test pages from real books, plus a deflated zip |
| `run-core-test.js` | runs `bindery-core.js` under Node: zip read/write, tone, XTC/XTCH, EPUBs, TXT/Markdown chapters |
| `check_outputs.py` | reads XTC/XTCH exactly as `XtcParser.cpp` + `XtcReaderActivity` do and renders each page to PNG; checks EPUB layout |
| `browser_test.py` | Playwright + installed Chrome against the standalone build: convert, save, screenshots |
| `mock_reader.py` | stand-in for the reader's web server: every page's route, the file API (`/api/files`, `/download`, `/upload`, `/mkdir`, `/rename`, `/move`, `/delete`), an in-memory `/api/dashboards` and `/api/todo`, and the WebSocket upload protocol, writing to a folder |
