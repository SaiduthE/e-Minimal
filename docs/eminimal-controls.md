# e-Minimal five-button controls

e-Minimal has five physical buttons: four front keys in a row under the
screen — Back, Select (Confirm), Up, Down, left to right as the hint bar
draws them — plus Power. No side buttons, no Left/Right, no touch.
`five_button::active()`
(`src/util/FiveButtonInput.h`) is the runtime gate every screen below checks:
true whenever the board has no touch, is `DigitalButtons`, and has Left or
Right unassigned. Upstream boards with a real Left/Right keep their own grammar.
Everything below names the logical roles; which physical key plays each role
is the user's key map (next section).

## Key map and orientation
- **Remap Front Buttons** (Settings > Controls) assigns the four front keys
  to Back, Select, Up, Down. The wizard asks "Press the button for …" for each
  role in turn; a key already taken is refused. Keys assign on release. After
  the fourth, a summary shows the new layout and waits: pressing the new
  Select key (hinted "Save") saves; nothing is written before that. Hold Back
  (the current Back) 1 s at any point to cancel; hold Select (the current
  Select) 1 s to reset to the default layout and exit. Power is not a role;
  its hold still opens the power menu. Stored as `buttonMapBack`,
  `buttonMapConfirm`, `buttonMapUp`, `buttonMapDown` (HalGPIO::BTN_* indices)
  in settings.json; anything but a permutation of the four keys resets to
  the default (`CrossPointSettings::validateButtonMap()`).
- **Page Turn Buttons** picks the reader direction: "Up = back, Down =
  forward" (default) or "Down = back, Up = forward". Same `sideButtonLayout`
  field and indices as upstream's Side Button Layout; its other values
  (Disabled, Next/Next, Prev/Prev) aren't offered here.
- **Orient Front Buttons** (off by default) turns Up/Down with the device when
  the reader is rotated: swapped in Inverted and Landscape CCW (the Down key
  comes first on screen there), unchanged in Portrait and Landscape CW. The
  hint bar labels swap with them. Table: `MappedInputManager::upDownKey()`.
- Stays physical whatever the map: the boot-time Up+Power recovery hold and
  the Power+Down screenshot chord. The boot-time Back hold (skip resuming the
  book) follows the map.

## Home
Up/Down walk one flat list: current book, then the grid, then the bottom
tabs, wrapping at both ends. Hold Down jumps to the tabs, hold Up to the
first book. Select opens the highlighted item; Back resumes the most
recently read book directly (when one exists).

## Library / Settings ring
Up/Down move the tab band; Select drops into that tab's rows, which loop;
Back climbs back out to the tab band. Hold Select opens that tab's own
options (e.g. sort order) only on the tab band; on a row it opens
recent-book options, delete, or collapse instead, where offered
(`LibraryListActivity.cpp:727-738`).

## Reader
Up/Down turn pages (direction: Page Turn Buttons); hold either to skip a
chapter, when enabled in Settings (Long-press behaviour). With Orient Front
Buttons on, a rotated page keeps "up" on screen as Up (see Key map above).
Select opens the reader menu (forced to List style
here — Toolbar needs touch). Hold Select drops/clears a bookmark, when
enabled in Settings (Long-press menu function) — both are OFF by default
(`longPressButtonBehavior = OFF`, `longPressMenuFunction = LP_MENU_DISABLED`
in `CrossPointSettings.h`). Back short
goes Home; held past `GO_BACK_OR_HOME_MS` it opens the file browser instead
(or the reverse, if `backShortToFileBrowser` is set).

## Keyboard (on-device)
A linear walk over the key grid, not Left/Right + Up/Down cursor motion:
Up/Down step through keys row-major, wrapping row-to-row and end-to-end.
Select types the highlighted key; hold Select submits. Back deletes a
character (cancels on an empty field); hold Back always cancels.

## Text entry chooser (reader or phone)
Two rows: type on this reader, or on a phone via a QR code. Select picks
one; hold Select remembers it as the default (Settings > Controls > Text
Entry) and skips the chooser next time.

## Go to % / Time to sleep
Up/Down press for ±1 (±1 minute); hold either to repeat at the dialog's
large step: Go to % steps by 10, Time to Sleep by 5 (`SettingsActivity.cpp:492`).
Hints read "Press Up/Down: 1" / "Hold Up/Down: <large step>"; the Up slot
shows "+", Down shows "-".

## Dictionary word select
A tap of Up/Down steps one word at a time. Holding either (≥500 ms) jumps a
line instead, repeating every 350 ms; the release ending a line-jump hold
does not also step a word. Select looks up the word; Back returns to the reader.

## Wi-Fi list
The network list gains a trailing "Scan again" row (Select rescans), since
there is no Right button to rescan with directly. Hold Select on a saved
network forgets it. The save/forget prompts hint Up/Down in place of
Left/Right to move between Yes/No.

## OPDS browser
Up/Down move the row selection; Select opens or downloads the entry; hold
Select opens search when the feed offers one (no synthetic row, which would
shift every entry's index). Back climbs the feed hierarchy.

## Power
Hold Power ~0.7 s while awake for the power menu. Hold Power ~1 s while
asleep to wake. A short tap does nothing either way — no double-click
frontlight shortcut here.

The power menu opens on Sleep, so hold Power then Select still sleeps. Above
the rows (Sleep, Go Home, Refresh Screen) sit three app tiles: **Reader**,
**Dashboard**, **Games**. Up/Down walk one ring through the tiles and then the
rows. The app that is open has a heavier frame and says "Open"; Select on it
just closes the menu, Select on another switches to it. Reader resumes the book
that was on screen when the reader was left, else opens Home; Games opens Game
Night. Go Home is the reader's Home, so it also switches to Reader.

## Apps and boot
The device boots and wakes into the app last opened (`lastApp` in
`/.crosspoint/state.json`): the reader as before (the book it slept in, or
Home), the Dashboard, or Game Night. Hold Back through boot or wake to land on
Home whichever app it was. Game Night reboots when it is left (to shed the
WiFi heap), so switching away from Games shows the loading popup first.

## Dashboard
Today's date (when the board has a clock), a count of open and done tasks,
and the to-do list (`/.crosspoint/todo.json`, up to 50 tasks of 80
characters). The first row adds a task through the usual text entry (reader
keyboard or phone). Select on a task ticks it done or not done; hold Select on
a task for Mark Done / Not Done, Edit Task, Delete and Clear Done Tasks. Back
does nothing here: the Dashboard is an app root, switched from the power menu.

## Hidden on this board, and why
Settings hides Menu Style in the reader section (forced to List; Toolbar
needs Left/Right or touch). Upstream's Side Button Layout shows as Page Turn
Buttons with its two directions only — Disabled, Next/Next and Prev/Prev
leave no key turning one way. Display hides UI Theme: e-Minimal ships its
own theme only (`FREEINK_DEVICE_EMINIMAL`; `fromJson()` pins `uiTheme` to
`EMINIMAL`). Home Button settings stay gated on `hasHomeKey()`, which this
board lacks.

## Divergence from the vault
The Obsidian vault's 04 §2 button table predates this pass and differs (Back
short = "advance ring", Select long = "full refresh"). What is actually
built: Back climbs rather than advancing a ring, and Refresh lives in the
power menu, not on a held Select. Treat this file as current until the vault
is amended.
